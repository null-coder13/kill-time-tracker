## Introduction
Currently, there is no plugin that maintains a record of all the kill times for a given boss. The goal of this plugin is to track all boss times for a given boss and provide the player with statistics.

## Design Mockup
![boss selection](images/boss-selection.png)  
Here the user can select a boss they want to see statistics on. Once they select the boss it will bring them to the next screen.

![statistics](images/boss-stats.png)  
This is an example for the data that will be displayed after selecting a boss. The reset button allows the user to reset all of the boss times for selected boss.
